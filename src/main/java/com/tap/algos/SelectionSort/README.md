# Selection Sort Algorithm

1. Iterating through the array beginning from index 0 (General index)
    - Where the element on general index is set as smallest
2. Iterating from general index till array length (Current index).
    - Finding the min value of the current loop
    - Swapping the elements on general index with the element with current min value.
